        <h3>What is a Monitor?</h3>
        <p>A monitor does what it says - monitors your systems to establish whether your applications are running or not. If the monitor fails then a reaction is triggered.</p>

      <div class="question-block">
        <h3>What is a Reaction?</h3>
        <p>A monitor will trigger reactions when your application is down. Reactions can be configured to:</p>

        <h3>What is a Runbook?</h3>
        <p>Runbooks have existed for a very long time; In the original term a Runbook was a physical book used by operations teams as a reference. These books would commonly describe an issue and provide the reader with all of the steps or commands necessary to resolve the issue. Today these physical books have mostly been replaced with team wikis. For the most part these runbooks would be detailed enough to allow operations engineers to resolve common issues with only the issues not covered in the runbook being escalated.</p>

        <h3>Is <strong>runbook.io</strong> a Runbook Automation tool?</h3>
        <p>Yes, and No. While Reactions are pretty much an example of runbook automation, traditionally runbook automation for incidents were initiated by a human. We have taken the human out of this process. Our system is designed to detect issues and then initiate a predefined process automatically.</p>
