# Logentries

## Logentries: Webhook

Users of Logentries can define unique [Alerts](https://logentries.com/doc/tagsalerts/) that call outside services such as Email, PagerDuty or even a generic Webhook. This monitor will create a unique webhook endpoint that you can configure Logentries to call when it detects an Alert. This integration allows you to combine Runbook Reactions with Logentries alerts.

### URL Details

Upon creating the monitor you will be provided with two unique URL's. These URL's can be the destination of the Logentries webhook.

**Unique Failed URL:**

    https://dash.runbook.io/api/logentries-webhook/example-api-id/example-api-key/failed

**Unique Healthy URL:**

    https://dash.runbook.io/api/logentries-webhook/example-api-id/example-api-key/healthy

Since Logentries does not send healthy webhook events this monitor has two URLs, one for failed alerts and another for healthy alerts. Once a monitor is marked failed it will not be marked healthy until the healthy URL is also called. It is best practice for every failed alert in Logentries to create a second alert for healthy states.

#### URL Secrecy

It is important to note that Logentries does not provide a way to authenticate the request. With that in mind authentication is performed by simply requesting the above URL's. These are unique per monitor but should be treated as sensitive information.
